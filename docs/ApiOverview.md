# Api Overview

When i was creating the frontend i realized that it was kinda hard to find the
endpoint i needed to make what i wanted, so i created an api overview with
excalidraw to help find the endpoint i need, once you find the endpoint you need
go to the api documentation to see inputs and outputs.
